# ToggleLed_MotionSensor
## Toggle Led
This circuit generates an on/off toggle motion. One of the major components of this circuit is a transistor. A transistor is a miniature semiconductor that regulates or controls current or voltage flow together with amplifying and generating electrical signals.

## Motion Sensor
This sensor provides information about when to turn on and off the light bulb. Using a motion sensor, the light bulb turns on when motion is detected within a certain range, and turns off when there is no motion after a specific time.
